My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/6999957914">5 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
Comical and entertaining. <br /><br />I sometimes struggle with sci-fi/fantasy because the limitations of their fictive universes can be vague or inconsistent, which makes it harder for me to enjoy the plot. For example, in a book about magic, I often end up wondering why doesn’t one character just use their magic in a specific tense moment, or I’d wonder <i>“well if they could do that, why can they not do this other thing”</i>. <br />But this book didn’t have me bothering with any of this at all, because it’s clear from the beginning that the book is carrying you on a whimsical journey, rather than have you fear for the characters’ lives or well-being. <br />The universe of this book is very complex, with many alien civilizations and exotic space traveling that make humans’ technology look like the primitive way of starting a fire with stones and sticks looks to us now. But the author doesn’t force you to keep track of convoluted explanations of all of these strange aliens and their origins. Instead, it’s like he’s saying: “Trust me, maybe this all sounds a bit weird, but I am telling you only what’s relevant, curious or hilarious.” <br />Since this book feels more like a hike through Douglas’ world than a plot driven book, the ambiguity over how his universe works is not relevant. You’re just there for the ride, and Douglas’ writing is funny and draws humorous and insightful parallels to our world all the time.

It was exciting to finally get all the pop culture references to 42. I've heard jokes about it many times in the engineering community, and even tough I knew the book it was coming from, I didn't know the full story...

    <p> The answer to life, the universe, and everything is 42! I quite fancied the idea that Earth is just a simulation on some super-intelligent species' computer. And before you think of The Matrix... Adams published <i> The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy </i> in 1979, 20 years before the first movie of the famous film series came out. I also chuckled when learning that the super-intelligent alien life form was in fact...lab mice. (I feel really sad for animals that endure harsh treatment in this way - so I almost wish Douglas' tale was true). And I found it interesting that not unlike humans, these super-intelligent life forms ended up being blocked by the existential question. Why are we alive? Why are we conscious, self-aware? What is the point of it all? </p>
